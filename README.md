# PSX Data Pipeline Using Airflow, Docker, and SQL Server

![Project Architecture](./psx.jpg)

## üìå Project Overview

This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of stock market data from the **Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)** into a **Microsoft SQL Server** database using the following technologies:

- **Python**: For web scraping and data processing.
- **Apache Airflow**: To orchestrate and schedule ETL tasks.
- **SQLAlchemy**: To interface with the SQL Server database.
- **Docker**: To containerize and manage the entire workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Web Scraping**  
   Python scripts scrape stock data from the PSX website.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   The raw data is cleaned and transformed into a structured format using Python.

3. **Load to Database**  
   The transformed data is inserted into a Microsoft SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy.

4. **Orchestration with Airflow**  
   All steps are orchestrated using Airflow DAGs, ensuring automation and scheduling.

5. **Containerization with Docker**  
   Docker containers encapsulate the environment for consistent deployment.
